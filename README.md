<p align="center"> Hi ðŸ‘‹ <br> I'm Shubham (suu-b) ! </p>

---

As of Summer 2025, I'm a CS student exploring the tech world I've stumbled into. I love to do creative stuff. The greatest gift software engineering has given me is the ability to materialize my ideas. You can learn more about me [here](https://suub.netlify.app/). Feel free to stroll through the repositories I've created â€” most are personal projects, while others are from coursework. Thanks for stopping by!
